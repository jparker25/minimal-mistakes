<details><summary><span style="font-size:0.75em;">Abstract</span></summary><span style="font-size:0.75em;">Neurons in the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) transmit information about basal ganglia output to dozens of brain regions in thalamocortical and brainstem motor networks. Activity of SNr neurons is regulated by convergent input from upstream basal ganglia nuclei, including GABAergic inputs from the striatum and the external globus pallidus (GPe). GABAergic inputs from the striatum convey information from the direct pathway, while GABAergic inputs from the GPe convey information from the indirect pathway. Chronic loss of dopamine, as occurs in Parkinson's disease, disrupts the balance of direct and indirect pathway neurons at the level of the striatum, but the question of how dopamine loss affects information propagation along these pathways outside of the striatum is less well understood. Using a combination of in vivo and slice electrophysiology, we find that dopamine depletion selectively weakens the direct pathway's influence over neural activity in the SNr due to changes in the decay kinetics of GABA-mediated synaptic currents. GABAergic signaling from GPe neurons in the indirect pathway was not affected, resulting in an inversion of the normal balance of inhibitory control over basal ganglia output through the SNr. These results highlight the contribution of cellular mechanisms outside of the striatum that impact the responses of basal ganglia output neurons to the direct and indirect pathways in disease.</span></details>

In: Journal of Neuroscience Methods 401 (Jan. 2024), p. 110000. doi: [10.1016/j.jneumeth.2023.110000](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2023.110000)</span>
<details><summary><span style="font-size:0.75em;">Abstract</span></summary><span style="font-size:0.75em;">Background: This work presents a toolbox that implements methodology for automated classification of diverse neural responses to optogenetic stimulation or other changes in conditions, based on spike train recordings. New Method: The toolbox implements what we call the Spike Train Response Classification algorithm (STReaC), which compares measurements of activity during a baseline period with analogous measurements during a subsequent period to identify various responses that might result from an event such as introduction of a sustained stimulus. The analyzed response types span a variety of patterns involving distinct time courses of increased firing, or excitation, decreased firing, or inhibition, or combinations of these. Excitation (inhibition) is identified from a comparative analysis of the spike density function (interspike interval function) for the baseline period relative to the corresponding function for the response period. Results: The STReaC algorithm as implemented in this toolbox provides a user-friendly, tunable, objective methodology that can detect a variety of neuronal response types and associated subtleties. We demonstrate this with single-unit neural recordings of rodent substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) during optogenetic stimulation of the globus pallidus externa (GPe). Comparison with existing methods: In several examples, we illustrate how the toolbox classifies responses in situations in which traditional methods (spike counting and visual inspection) either fail to detect a response or provide a false positive. Conclusions: The STReaC toolbox provides a simple, efficient approach for classifying spike trains into a variety of response types defined relative to a period of baseline spiking.</span></details>
